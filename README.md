# I touch and nano txt file locally in my local branch. so I could see it is created in local main folder. 
then I use git push origin(defualt) but I did not see the txt in remote here
so the issue is we must have txt in our local respo first. then when we change or add files in branch we are working in working tree 
so we need to use git add . to put our changes in staging area then use git commit -m "desription" to commit changes to our local respo 
then use git push remote_ remote_branch. t.e.x git push origin main. origin is the remote and it is usually the same for all remote respo. main is the remote branch 
usually when we push we need to push from our local branch to the same remote branch.
